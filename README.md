## What is this project?
This is a project that was worked on from a Udemy Course **React, NodeJS, Express & MongoDB - The MERN Fullstack Guide** by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Manuel Lorenz.

This is the url to the course: https://www.udemy.com/share/102fVS3@3XQTBvwWFFsNYfBJWZU2cURbUzxzYcRQgfIPvsImq0i_4l3NsG5VH4HSQsEtj6fCuQ==/

## Project Setup
To run this project after cloning it, run 
``` npm install ```
to download all the node modules needed.

## API Keys and Variables
Changing variables happens in the ```.env``` file for local development and ```.env.production``` for production. The backend was running on ```http://localhost:5000``` in my case.
A Google API Key is not provided since an alternate map was used.
